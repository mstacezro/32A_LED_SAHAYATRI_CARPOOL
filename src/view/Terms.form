Creation of an Account&#xa;The Platform enables Members to post Carpooling Adverts and view Adverts and to interact with each other to book a Seat. You can view the Adverts if you are not registered on the Platform.

Verification&#xa;Sahayatri may, for the purposes of transparency, improving trust, or prevention or detection of fraud, set up a system for verification of some of the information you provide on your profile. This is notably the case when you enter your telephone number or provide us with an Identity document.&#xa;You recognise and accept that any reference on the Platform or the Services to &#x201c;verified&#x201d; information, or any similar term, means only that a Member has successfully passed the verification procedure existing on the Platform or the Services in order to provide you with more information about the Member with whom you are considering travelling. Sahayatri cannot guarantee the truthfulness, reliability or validity of the information subject of the verification procedure.&#xa;4.    Use of the Services&#xa;4.1.    Posting Adverts&#xa;As Member, and providing you fulfil the conditions below, you can create and post Carpooling Adverts on the Platform by entering information about the Trip you intend to make (dates/times and collection points and arrival, number of seats offered, options available, amount of the Cost Contribution, etc.).&#xa;When posting your Carpooling Advert, you can indicate the milestone cities in which you agree to stop, to pick up or drop off Passengers. The sections of the Carpooling Trip between these milestone cities or between one of these milestone towns and the collection point or destination of the Carpooling Trip constitute &#x201c;Legs&#x201d;.&#xa;You are only authorised to post a Carpooling Advert if you fulfil all the following conditions:&#xa;&#x2022;&#x9;(i)    you hold a valid driving licence;&#xa;&#x2022;&#x9;(ii)    you only offer Carpooling Adverts for vehicles you own or use with the express permission of the owner, and in all cases that you are authorised to use for the purposes of ridesharing;&#xa;&#x2022;&#x9;(iii)    you are and remain the main driver of the vehicle subject of the Carpooling Advert;&#xa;&#x2022;&#x9;(iv)    the vehicle has valid third party insurance;&#xa;&#x2022;&#x9;(v)    you have no contraindication or medical incapacity for driving;&#xa;&#x2022;&#x9;(vi)    the vehicle you intend to use for the Trip is a touring car with 4 wheels and a maximum of 7 seats, to the exclusion of cars requiring no licence to drive;&#xa;&#x2022;&#x9;(vii)    you do not intend posting another advert for the same Carpooling Trip on the Platform;&#xa;&#x2022;&#x9;(viii)    you do not offer more Seats than the number available in your vehicle;&#xa;&#x2022;&#x9;(ix)    all Seats offered have a seatbelt, even if the vehicle is approved with seats having no seatbelt;&#xa;&#x2022;&#x9;(x)    to use a vehicle in good working order and which complies with the applicable legal provisions and customs, notably with an up-to-date MoT certificate;&#xa;&#x2022;&#x9;(xi)       you are a consumer and do not act as a professional.&#xa;You recognise that you are solely responsible for the content of the Carpooling Advert you post on the Platform. Consequently, you represent and warrant the accuracy and truthfulness of all information contained in your Carpooling Advert, and you undertake to fulfil the Trip under the conditions described in your Carpooling Advert.&#xa;Your Carpooling Advert will be posted on the Platform and therefore visible to Members and all visitors, even non-members, conducting a search on the Platform or on the website of Sahayatri&#x2019;s partners. Sahayatri reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without notice, to not post or to remove, at any time, any Carpooling Advert that does not comply with the T&amp;Cs or that it considers as damaging to its image, that of the Platform, or that of the Services.&#xa;You are informed that in the event that you present yourself as a consumer by using the Platform when in fact you act as a professional, you are exposed to sanctions provided by the applicable law.&#xa;4.2.    Booking a Seat when carpooling&#xa;Sahayatri has set up a system for booking Seats online ( &#x201c;Booking&#x201d;) for Trips offered on the Platform.&#xa;The methods of booking of a Seat depend on the nature of the Trip envisaged.&#xa;Sahayatri provides to users on the Platform a search engine based on different search criteria (Place of origin, destination, dates, number of travelers, etc.). Certain additional functionalities are provided on the search engine when the user is connected with his/her Account. Sahayatri invites the user, regardless of the booking process used, to carefully consult and use the search engine to determine the offer that is most adapted to his/her needs. The Customer, booking a Bus Trip on a Point of Sales can also ask the Bus Operator or the desk agent to do the search.&#xa;4.2.1 Carpooling Trip&#xa;When a Passenger is interested in a Carpooling Advert benefiting from Booking, he may make an online Booking request. This Booking request is either (i) accepted automatically (if the Driver chose this option when posting his Advert), or (ii) accepted manually by the Driver. At the time of the Booking, the Passenger makes the online payment of the Cost Contribution and the related Service Fees, where applicable. After receipt of the payment by Sahayatri and validation of the Booking request by the Driver, where applicable, the Passenger receives a Booking confirmation (the &#x201c;Booking Confirmation&#x201d;).&#xa;If you are a Driver and have chosen to handle manually the Bookings requests when posting your Advert, you are required to respond to any Booking request within the  timeframe specified by the Passenger during the Booking request.

Consequently, any changes will result in either an exchange or cancellation under the conditions of the applicable GT&amp;Cs of Sales. It is the responsibility of the Customer to ensure that the Transport Services are chosen in accordance with the Passenger&#x2019;s needs and expectations. The accuracy of the Personal Information entered by the Customer is the responsibility of the latter except in the event of Sahayatri proven failure to collect, store or protect such Personal Information.&#xa;6.
