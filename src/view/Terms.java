Creation of an Account\nThe Platform enables Members to post Carpooling Adverts and view Adverts and to interact with each other to book a Seat. You can view the Adverts if you are not registered on the Platform. However, you cannot post a Carpooling Advert or book a Seat without having first created an Account and become a Member.\nTo create your Account, you can:\n•\t(i)    either complete all mandatory fields on the registration form;\n•\t(ii)    or log in to your Facebook account via our Platform (hereinafter referred to as your “Facebook Account”). In using such functionality, you understand that Sahayatri will have access to, will publish on the Platform, and will keep certain information from your Facebook Account.

If you lose or disclose your password, you undertake to inform Sahayatri immediately. You alone are responsible for the use of your Account by third parties, unless you have expressly notified Sahayatri of the loss, the fraudulent use by a third party, or the disclosure of your password to a third party.\nYou agree not to create or use, under your own identity or that of a third party, Accounts other than that initially created.\n3.3.    Verification\nSahayatri may, for the purposes of transparency, improving trust, or prevention or detection of fraud, set up a system for verification of some of the information you provide on your profile. This is notably the case when you enter your telephone number or provide us with an Identity document.\nYou recognise and accept that any reference on the Platform or the Services to “verified” information, or any similar term, means only that a Member has successfully passed the verification procedure existing on the Platform or the Services in order to provide you with more information about the Member with whom you are considering travelling. Sahayatri cannot guarantee the truthfulness, reliability or validity of the information subject of the verification procedure.\n4.    Use of the Services\n4.1.    Posting Adverts\nAs Member, and providing you fulfil the conditions below, you can create and post Carpooling Adverts on the Platform by entering information about the Trip you intend to make (dates/times and collection points and arrival, number of seats offered, options available, amount of the Cost Contribution, etc.).\nWhen posting your Carpooling Advert, you can indicate the milestone cities in which you agree to stop, to pick up or drop off Passengers. The sections of the Carpooling Trip between these milestone cities or between one of these milestone towns and the collection point or destination of the Carpooling Trip constitute “Legs”.\nYou are only authorised to post a Carpooling Advert if you fulfil all the following conditions:\n•\t(i)    you hold a valid driving licence;\n•\t(ii)    you only offer Carpooling Adverts for vehicles you own or use with the express permission of the owner, and in all cases that you are authorised to use for the purposes of ridesharing;\n•\t(iii)    you are and remain the main driver of the vehicle subject of the Carpooling Advert;\n•\t(iv)    the vehicle has valid third party insurance;\n•\t(v)    you have no contraindication or medical incapacity for driving;\n•\t(vi)    the vehicle you intend to use for the Trip is a touring car with 4 wheels and a maximum of 7 seats, to the exclusion of cars requiring no licence to drive;\n•\t(vii)    you do not intend posting another advert for the same Carpooling Trip on the Platform;\n•\t(viii)    you do not offer more Seats than the number available in your vehicle;\n•\t(ix)    all Seats offered have a seatbelt, even if the vehicle is approved with seats having no seatbelt;\n•\t(x)    to use a vehicle in good working order and which complies with the applicable legal provisions and customs, notably with an up-to-date MoT certificate;\n•\t(xi)       you are a consumer and do not act as a professional.\nYou recognise that you are solely responsible for the content of the Carpooling Advert you post on the Platform. Consequently, you represent and warrant the accuracy and truthfulness of all information contained in your Carpooling Advert, and you undertake to fulfil the Trip under the conditions described in your Carpooling Advert.\nYour Carpooling Advert will be posted on the Platform and therefore visible to Members and all visitors, even non-members, conducting a search on the Platform or on the website of Sahayatri’s partners. Sahayatri reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without notice, to not post or to remove, at any time, any Carpooling Advert that does not comply with the T&Cs or that it considers as damaging to its image, that of the Platform, or that of the Services.\nYou are informed that in the event that you present yourself as a consumer by using the Platform when in fact you act as a professional, you are exposed to sanctions provided by the applicable law.\n4.2.    Booking a Seat when carpooling\nSahayatri has set up a system for booking Seats online ( “Booking”) for Trips offered on the Platform.\nThe methods of booking of a Seat depend on the nature of the Trip envisaged.\nSahayatri provides to users on the Platform a search engine based on different search criteria (Place of origin, destination, dates, number of travelers, etc.). Certain additional functionalities are provided on the search engine when the user is connected with his/her Account. Sahayatri invites the user, regardless of the booking process used, to carefully consult and use the search engine to determine the offer that is most adapted to his/her needs. The Customer, booking a Bus Trip on a Point of Sales can also ask the Bus Operator or the desk agent to do the search.\n4.2.1 Carpooling Trip\nWhen a Passenger is interested in a Carpooling Advert benefiting from Booking, he may make an online Booking request. This Booking request is either (i) accepted automatically (if the Driver chose this option when posting his Advert), or (ii) accepted manually by the Driver. At the time of the Booking, the Passenger makes the online payment of the Cost Contribution and the related Service Fees, where applicable. After receipt of the payment by Sahayatri and validation of the Booking request by the Driver, where applicable, the Passenger receives a Booking confirmation (the “Booking Confirmation”).\nIf you are a Driver and have chosen to handle manually the Bookings requests when posting your Advert, you are required to respond to any Booking request within the  timeframe specified by the Passenger during the Booking request. Otherwise, the Booking request will expire automatically and the Passenger shall be refunded all sums paid at the time of the Booking request, if any.\nAt the time of the Booking Confirmation, Sahayatri will send you the telephone number of the Driver (if you are the Passenger) or of the Passenger (if you are the Driver), if the Member agreed to display his/her phone number. You are then solely responsible for executing the contract binding you to the other Member.\n4.2.3 Named nature of the Seat booking and terms of use of the Services on behalf of a third party\nAny use of the Services, in the capacity of Passenger or Driver, relates to a specific name. The Driver and the Passenger must correspond to the identity communicated to Sahayatri and the other Members participating in the Carpooling Trip or to the Bus Operator, where applicable.\nHowever, Sahayatri allows its Members to book one or more Seats on behalf of a third party. In this case, you undertake to accurately indicate to the Driver, at the time of the Booking, the forenames, age and telephone number of the person on whose behalf you are reserving a Seat. It is strictly prohibited to book a Seat for a minor under the age of 13 travelling alone for a Carpooling Trip. In the case where you are reserving a seat Carpooling Trip for a minor over the age of 13 travelling alone, you undertake to request the prior agreement of the Driver and to provide him with duly completed and signed permission of his/her legal representatives.\nIn addition, the Platform is intended for the booking of Seats for individuals. It is forbidden to book a Seat for transporting any object, package, animal traveling alone or material items whatsoever.\nFurthermore, it is prohibited to publish a Carpooling Advert for a Driver other than you.\n4.3.    Review system\n4.3.1.    Operation\nSahayatri encourages you to leave a review about a Driver (if you are a Passenger) or about a Passenger (if you are a Driver) with whom you have shared a Trip or with whom you were supposed to share a Trip. However, you are not permitted to leave a review about another Passenger if you were a Passenger, or about a Member with whom you have not travelled or with whom you were not supposed to travel.\nYour review, and the review left by another Member about you, if any,, are only visible and published on the Platform after the shorter of the following periods: (i) immediately after you have both left a review, or (ii) after a period of 14 days following the first review.\nYou have the option of responding to a review that another Member has left on your profile. The review and your response, where applicable, will be published on your profile.\n4.3.2.    Moderation\nYou recognise and accept that Sahayatri reserves the right not to publish or to delete any review, any question, any comment or any response if it deems its content breaches these T&Cs.\n4.3.3.    Limit\nSahayatri reserves the right to suspend your Account, limit your access to the Services, or terminate these T&Cs in the case where (i) you have received at least three reviews and (ii) the average review you have received is less than or equal to 3.\n5.    Financial conditions\nAccess to and registration on the Platform, as well as searching, viewing and posting Adverts, are free of charge. However, the Booking is charged under the conditions described below.\n5.1.    Cost Contribution and Price\n5.1.1 In the event of Carpooling trip, the Cost Contribution is determined by you, as Driver, under your sole responsibility. It is strictly prohibited to profit in any way from using our Platform. Consequently, you agree to limit the Cost Contribution you ask your Passengers to pay to the costs you actually incur to make the Carpooling Trip. Otherwise, you alone will bear the risks of recharacterization of the transaction completed via the Platform.\nWhen you post a Carpooling Advert, Sahayatri will suggest an amount of for the Cost Contribution, which notably takes account of the nature of the Carpooling Trip and the distance travelled. This amount is given purely as a guideline and it is up to you to increase it or reduce it to take account of the costs you actually incur on the Carpooling Trip. To avoid abuse, Sahayatri limits the possibility of adjustment of the Cost Contribution.\n5.1.2 Regarding the Bus Trip, the Price per Seat is defined at the Bus Operator sole’s discretion. The Customer is invited to refer to the relevant GT&Cs of Sale to understand applicable modalities with regards to Ticket order placement and payment modalities. \n5.2.    Service Fees\nSahayatri, in exchange for use of the Platform, at the time of Booking shall collect service fees (hereinafter referred to as the “Service Fees”). The user will be informed before any application of the Service fees, when required. The methods of calculation of the Service Fees in force that can be found here are provided for information purposes only and do not have contractual value. Sahayatri reserves the right to modify at any time the methods of calculation of the Service fees. These modification will not affect the Service Fees accepted by users before the date of entry in effect of these modifications.\nIn the case of cross-border journeys, please note that the methods of calculation of the amount of the Service Fees and the applicable VAT vary according to the collection point and/or destination of the Trip.\nWhen using the Platform for cross-border trips or out of the United Kingdom, the Service Fees may be charged by an affiliate company of Sahayatri operating the local platform.\n5.3.    Rounding\nYou recognise and accept that Sahayatri may, at its full discretion, round up or down the Service Fees and the Cost Contribution.\n5.4.    Methods of payment and repayment of the Cost Contribution to the Driver or the Price to Bus Operators\n5.4.1.    Collection mandate\nIn using the Platform as Driver for Carpooling Trips, you confer on Sahayatri a collection mandate for the Cost Contribution in your name and on your behalf.\nConsequently, in the context of a Carpooling Trip, and after manual or automatic acceptance of the Booking, Sahayatri shall collect the whole of the sum paid by the Passenger (Service Fees and Cost Contribution).\nThe Cost Contributions received by Sahayatri are deposited in an account dedicated to payment of the Drivers.\nYou recognise and accept that none of the sums received by Sahayatri in the name and on behalf of the Driver gives entitlement to interest. You agree to respond diligently to any request of Sahayatri, and more generally of any administrative or court authority competent particularly in the prevention or combating of money laundering. Notably, you agree to provide, on simple request, any useful evidence of address and/or identity.\nIn the absence of response to these requests, Sahayatri may take any measure it deems appropriate, notably freezing of the sums paid and/or suspension of your Account and/or termination of these T&Cs.\n5.4.2.    Payment of the Cost Contribution to the Driver\nAfter the Trip, the Passengers shall have a period of 24 hours to submit a claim on the Trip to Sahayatri. In the absence of claim of the Passengers within this period, Sahayatri shall consider the Trip confirmed.\nFrom the time of this express or tacit confirmation, you shall have, as Driver, a credit payable on your Account. This credit corresponds to the total amount paid by the Passenger at the time of confirmation of the Booking reduced by the Service Fees, i.e. the Cost Contribution paid by the Passenger.\nWhen the Carpooling Trip is confirmed by the Passenger, you have the option, as a Driver, of giving instructions to Sahayatri to pay the money to your bank account (by entering your bank details in advance in your Account) or your PayPal account (by entering your PayPal email address in advance in your Account).\nThe payment order in your name will be sent on the first working day after your request or, if you do not so request, within 15 days of provision of the sums in question to your profile (providing Sahayatri has your bank information).\nAt the end of the applicable time limitation periods, any sum not claimed from Sahayatri shall be deemed to belong to Sahayatri.\n5.4.3 Paiement of the Price\nPayment for any Order made through the Platform is made by one of the means authorized below. The Customer has the option of saving the information relating to one or more credit cards in his/her Customer Account so that he or she does not have to systematically enter this information when making subsequent payments.\nThe means of payment can vary depending on the Sahayatri platform you use. The authorized means of payment are as follows: \n•\tCredit card\n•\tPaypal\n•\tVouchers\nNo Order confirmation shall be issued before the full and effective payment of the price of the Transport Services selected by the Customer. If the payment is irregular, incomplete or not made for any reason attributable to the Customer, the Order shall be cancelled immediately.\nThe Order is confirmed by sending an e-mail to the Customer containing the details of the Order.\nThe Passenger is invited to check the settings for the inbox of his/her e-mail address and in particular to ensure that the confirmation e-mail is not sent directly to Spam.\nConfirmation of the Order is final. Consequently, any changes will result in either an exchange or cancellation under the conditions of the applicable GT&Cs of Sales. It is the responsibility of the Customer to ensure that the Transport Services are chosen in accordance with the Passenger’s needs and expectations. The accuracy of the Personal Information entered by the Customer is the responsibility of the latter except in the event of Sahayatri proven failure to collect, store or protect such Personal Information.\n6.    Non-commercial and non-business purpose of the Services and the Platform\nYou agree to use the Services and the Platform only to be put into contact, on a non-business and non-commercial basis, with people wishing to share a Carpooling Trip with you or to book a Seat in the context of a Bus Trip.\nAs Driver, you agree not to request a Cost Contribution higher than the costs you actually incur and that may generate a profit, being specified that in the context of a cost sharing, you have to bear as a Driver your own part of the costs induced by the Trip. You are solely responsible for calculating the costs you incur for the Trip and for checking that the amount requested of your Passengers does not exceed the costs you actually incur (excluding your share of the costs) notably by referring to the applicable tax scale.\nSahayatri reserves the right to suspend your Account in the case where you use a chauffeur-driven or other business vehicle or taxi, or a company car, and due to this, generate a profit from the Platform. You agree to provide to Sahayatri, on its simple request, a copy of your car registration certificate and/or any other document showing that you are authorised to use this vehicle on the Platform and are not drawing any profit therefrom.\nSahayatri also reserves the right to suspend your Account, limit your access to the Services, or terminate these T&Cs, in the case of activity by you on the Platform which, owing to the nature of the Trips offered, their frequency, the number of Passengers carried and the Cost Contribution requested, entails a situation of profit for you, or for any reason suggesting to Sahayatri that you are generating a profit on the Platform.\n7.    Cancellation policy\n7.1.    Terms of repayment in the case of cancellation\nOnly Carpooling Trips are the subject of this cancellation policy; Sahayatri does not offer any guarantee, of any nature, in the case of a cancellation for any reason. In the context of Bus Trip, the cancellation policy is subject to the GT&Cs of Sale of the Bus Operators. The customer is invited to refer to the relevant GT&Cs of Sale to acknowledge the conditions of exchanges and cancellation of his/her Bus Trip.\nThe cancellation of a Seat on a Carpooling Trip by the Driver or the Passenger after Booking Confirmation is subject to the stipulations hereunder:\nIn the case of cancellation owing to the Driver, the Passenger is refunded the whole of the sum paid (i.e. the Cost Contribution and the related Service Fees). This is notably the case when Driver cancels a Carpooling Trip or has not arrived at the meeting point 15 minutes after the agreed time;\nIn the case of cancellation owing to the Passenger:\n•\t If the Passenger cancels more than 24 hours before the planned departure time as mentioned in the Carpooling Advert, the Passenger shall only be refunded the Cost Contribution. The Service Fees are retained by Sahayatri and the Driver does not receive any sum of any nature;\n•\tIf the Passenger cancels 24 hours or less before the planned departure time as mentioned in the Carpooling Advert, and more than thirty minutes after the Booking Confirmation, the Passenger shall be refunded half the Cost Contribution paid at the time of Booking, the Service Fees are retained by Sahayatri, and the Driver receives 50% of the Cost Contribution;\n•\tIf the Passenger cancels 24 hours or less before the planned departure time, as mentioned in the Carpooling Advert, and thirty minutes or less after the Booking Confirmation, the Passenger is refunded the whole of the Cost Contribution. The Service Fees are retained by Sahayatri and the Driver does not receive any sum of any nature;\n•\tIf the Passenger cancels after the planned departure time as mentioned in the Carpooling Advert, or if he has not arrived at the meeting place 15 minutes after the agreed time, no refund shall be issued. The Driver shall be compensated with the whole of the Cost Contribution and the Service Fees are kept by Sahayatri.\nWhen a cancellation occurs before departure and owing to the Passenger, the Seat(s) cancelled by the Passenger shall be automatically made available to other Passengers, who may book them online and they are accordingly subject to the conditions of these T&Cs.\nSahayatri appreciates, in its sole discretion, on the basis of the available information, the legitimacy of the refund requests.\n7.2.    Right of withdrawal\nYou have no right of withdrawal from the time of Booking Confirmation provided the Contract between you and Sahayatri consisting of putting you in contact with another Member has been fully executed.\n8.

Content published by Sahayatri\nSubject to the contents provided by its Members, Sahayatri is the sole holder of all intellectual property rights relating to the Service, the Platform, its content (notably texts, images, designs, logos, videos, sounds, data, graphics) and to the software and databases ensuring their operation.\nSahayatri grants you a non-exclusive, personal and non-transferable right to use the Platform and the Services, for your personal and private use, on a non-commercial basis and in compliance with the purposes of the Platform and the Services.\nYou are prohibited from any other use or exploitation of the Platform and Services, and their content, without the prior written permission of Sahayatri.

Nevertheless, access to the Platform may be temporarily suspended, without notice, owing to technical maintenance, migration or update operations, or owing to outages or constraints linked to the operation of the network.\nFurthermore, Sahayatri reserves the right to modify or suspend all or part of access to the Platform or its functionalities, at its sole discretion, temporarily or permanently.\n14.    Modification of the T&Cs\nThese T&Cs and the documents integrated by reference express the entire agreement between you and Sahayatri relative to your use of the Services. Any other document, notably any mention on the Platform (FAQ, etc.), is for guideline purposes only.\nSahayatri may modify these T&Cs in order to adapt to its technological and commercial environment, and to comply with the legislation in force. Any modification to these T&Cs will be published on the Platform with mention of the date of effect, and you will be notified by Sahayatri before it takes effect.\n15.
